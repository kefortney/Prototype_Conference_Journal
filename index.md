# Introduction to the Prototype Conference Journal

## THIS IS AN EXAMPLE AND NOT AN ACTIVE JOURNAL

Welcome to the inaugural edition of the Journal of Open Source Capacity in Academia (JOSCA), the official publication of the Building Open Source Capacity in Academia (BOSCA) conference series. Launching in 2025, BOSCA is an annual event that convenes university-based Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs), researchers, and practitioners from across the globe to explore the evolving landscape of open source research software.

In an era where collaboration, transparency, and reproducibility are paramount, open source software has become a cornerstone of academic research. Yet, sustaining robust open source ecosystems within academia presents unique challenges: fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration, navigating intellectual property policies, and securing funding for long-term maintenance. The BOSCA conference and this journal aim to address these challenges by creating a vibrant forum for knowledge sharing, innovation, and community building.

## A Living Document for Dynamic Exchange
The Journal is not a static publication but a living document, designed to grow and evolve alongside the community it serves. It invites participation from researchers, OSPO leaders, and open source advocates in academia through an innovative submission process. Contributors propose articles, talks, and panels via GitHub pull requests, fostering a collaborative workflow from the start. Accepted submissions can then be seamlessly transformed into dynamic presentations using RISE (Reveal.js â€“ Jupyter/IPython Slideshow Extension) for the BOSCA conference.

This journal not only documents the cutting-edge ideas presented at the conference but also serves as a hub for ongoing conversations. Through its GitHub repository, readers and contributors can engage in discussions, share tools, co-develop best practices, and collaborate on documentation that supports the open source research ecosystem.

## Themes and Topics
The first edition of showcases contributions that align with:

* Strategies for building and sustaining university OSPOs.
* Case studies of impactful open source research projects.
* Tools and workflows that enhance reproducibility in research.
* Policy recommendations for promoting open source practices in academia.
* Insights on fostering diverse, inclusive open source communities.

Each article reflects the shared commitment to advancing open source capacity in academic institutions, ensuring that software developed within research contexts can thrive in an open and accessible ecosystem.

## Join the Conversation
The Journal of Open Source Capacity in Academia embodies the open source ethos: collaborative, transparent, and community-driven. Whether you're a seasoned developer, a researcher exploring open source for the first time, or an advocate working to institutionalize open source in academia, your voice matters.

Submit your ideas, engage with the community, and help shape the future of open source in academia. Together, we can build the tools, practices, and policies that empower researchers and institutions to make lasting contributions to science and society.

Welcome to JOSCA, where the future of open source in academia takes shape.
