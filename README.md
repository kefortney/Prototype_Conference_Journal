## About the Journal

The journal acts as an ongoing repository for **multidisciplinary panels** created by contributors across academia. Submissions are encouraged from teams spanning multiple academic institutions, emphasizing **collaboration** and **diverse perspectives**. Accepted submissions will serve as both journal entries and presentation materials for open-source capacity-building events.
