## Authors

Dr. Alex Rivera, Open Science Institute, University of Examplel and Jamie Lee, Open Data Advocacy Network

## Abstract

This panel will explore strategies for leveraging open data to drive public good initiatives, emphasizing collaborative approaches between academia, government, and non-profits. We will discuss best practices in data sharing, governance models, and how to overcome common barriers to open data adoption. The session aims to equip participants with actionable insights into fostering open data ecosystems that benefit research, policy-making, and community engagement.
